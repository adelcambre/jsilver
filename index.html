<h1>Jonathan Silverman's Portfolio</h1>

<h2>realstories.heroku.com</h2>
<p>This site was written to teach myself Ruby on Rails.
It uses Heroku for hosting, Git for SCM, Haml/Sass for templating, Compass as a CSS framework,
Authlogic for authentication, RPX for OpenID integration, CanCan for authorization,
and a whole slew of other plugins.</p>

<h2>Compass</h2>
<p>Not <strong>my</strong> project per se, although I did help fix the Rails Template for Win32,
which is my first ever contribution to OSS!</p>

uploading of files via right-click context menu. Written in VB.NET for Windows XP.
Freeware. Downloaded over 100,000 times in over 50 countries. Website used Google
Analytics to track visitors. Popular on Tucows!</p>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>My name is Jonathan Silverman, I am 21 and
have been literally obsessed with computers since a very early age.
My very first computer was a Mac Centra 650 with a whopping 22mhz.
Since then I have taught myself many programming languages, including VB,
C++, PHP, and .NET, but recently I have found a favorite in Ruby and friends.</p>
